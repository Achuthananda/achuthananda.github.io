This is one book i started reading approximately 3.5 years back and for some reason I could not just finish it. Had tried reading multiple times, but I failed miserably. I even finished another book and half of Shri SL Bhyrappa after i started reading this.  A few months back my sense of completion knocked me over and ignited me to read this again. For my surprise i really loved reading this book and here I am today finishing this book with sense of accomplishment and joy.

Coming to the crux of the book, This book mainly talks about the caste system in India and how deep rooted it is in our societies. This book was authored in 1972 and I must say that this book will remain timeless in Indian Societies. Bhyrappa is known for his extraordinary abilities of weaving a very nice fiction around facts of a system. Irrespective of caste we belong to this book will take you for an introspective ride about the systems we belong to.
